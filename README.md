# Interactive Form

This project enhances an interactive registration form for a fictional conference called "FullStack Conf" using the jQuery library. The form is made to be more user friendly by adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity. It also validates user input and provides helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields. This project was created for the purpose of the Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree.

## Project Requirements

This project is reviewed and graded based on a set of requirements.

### Meets Expectations

* Project includes jQuery and utilizes it in at least some aspect of the form.
* On page load, the cursor appears in the "Name" field, ready for a user to type.
* "Your job role" text field appears when user selects "Other" from the Job Role menu.
* Until a theme is selected from the “Design” menu, no color options appear in the “Color” drop down and the “Color” field reads “Please select a T-shirt theme”.
* When a new theme is selected from the "Design" menu, the "Color" field and drop down menu is updated.
* User cannot select two activities that are at the same time.
* Total cost of selected activities is calculated and displayed below the list of activities.
* The "Credit Card" payment option is selected by default.
* Payment option in the select menu matches the payment option displayed on the page.
* When a user chooses a payment option, the chosen payment section is revealed and the other payment sections are hidden.
* Form cannot be submitted (the page does not refresh when the submit button is clicked) until the following requirements have been met:
* Name field isn’t blank.
* Email field contains validly formatted e-mail address.
* At least one checkbox under "Register for Activities" section must be selected.
* If "Credit Card" is the selected payment option, the three fields accept only numbers: a 13 to 16-digit credit card number, a 5-digit zip code, and 3-number CVV value.
* On submission, the form provides an error indication or message for each field that requires validation:
* Name field
* Email field
* “Register for Activities” checkboxes
* Credit Card number, Zip code, and CVV, only if the credit card payment method is selected. 

### Exceeds Expectations

* “Color” drop down menu is hidden until a T-Shirt design is selected.
* Form provides at least one error message in real time, before the form is submitted. For example, the error message appears near the email field when the user begins to type, and disappears as soon as the user has entered a complete and correctly formatted email address.
* Form provides at least one error message that changes depending on the error. For example, the email field displays a different error message when the email field is empty than it does when the email address is formatted incorrectly. *This is accomplished without the use of HTML5's built-in field validation.
